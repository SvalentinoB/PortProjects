# Simple Linear Regression - Fuel Consumption Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook and associated dataset to perform a simple linear regression analysis on vehicle fuel consumption data. The analysis predicts the impact of vehicle horsepower (HP) on fuel economy (Miles Per Gallon, MPG).

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Develop a predictive model to assess how increasing vehicle horsepower affects fuel economy.
- **Dataset**: `FuelEconomy.csv` includes two variables:
  - Independent Variable (X): Horse Power
  - Dependent Variable (Y): Fuel Economy (MPG)
- **Methodology**: Utilizes Python with libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` for data processing, visualization, and regression modeling.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` (2.2.2) for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for linear regression implementation

## Files
- `Simple_Linear_Regression_Fuel_Consumption.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis, including data import, visualization, model training, and prediction.
- `data/FuelEconomy.csv`: CSV file containing the raw dataset with 100 entries of horsepower and MPG values.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Simple_Linear_Regression_Fuel_Consumption
